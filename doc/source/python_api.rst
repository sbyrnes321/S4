Python API reference
====================

|S4| can be built as a `Python <http://python.org>`_ extension, in addition to the original `Lua <http://www.lua.org>`_ interface.
The current Python interface is not as fully featured as the Lua interface, but it should ultimately achieve feature parity.
Much auxiliary functionality, such as numerical integration, is not included here since `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ can easily be used instead.

S4 module
---------

.. module:: S4

All top level functions of |S4| are located in the ``S4`` library.

.. function:: New(Lattice, NumBasis)

   Returns a new `Simulation object`_.
   
   Usage::
   
	S = S4.New(Lattice=((1,0),(0,1)), NumBasis=100)
   
   Arguments:
   
	Lattice
		Sets the lattice vectors for the structure. This can be a single real number in the case of a 1D periodic lattice, or a pair of vectors for a 2D periodic lattice.
	NumBasis
		Sets the maximum number of in-plane (x and y) Fourier expansion orders to use.
		All fields and eigenmodes of the system use the same Fourier basis of the same dimension.
		The computation time is roughly proportional to the cube of this number, and the memory usage is roughly proportional to the square.
		This is equivalent to the "NumG" setting in the Lua interface.

   Return values:

	S
		A new `Simulation object`_.


Simulation object
-----------------

.. class:: Simulation

The Simulation object is the primary object which computes solutions to systems.
When a new Simulation object is requested from :func:`New`, all settings are in a blank state, with no materals, layers, or excitation.
When solutions are requested, only a minimal set of internal computations are performed in order to satisfy the request.

	)

   Arguments:

	IncidenceAngles
		(pair of numbers) Of the form (phi,theta) with angles in degrees.
		``phi`` and ``theta`` give the spherical coordinate angles of the planewave k-vector.
		For zero angles, the k-vector is assumed to be (0, 0, kz), while the electric field is assumed to be (E0, 0, 0), and the magnetic field is in (0, H0, 0). The angle ``phi`` specifies first the angle by which the E,H,k frame should be rotated (CW) about the y-axis, and the angle ``theta`` specifies next the angle by which the E,H,k frame should be rotated (CCW) about the z-axis.

   Return values:

	None

Outputs requiring no solutions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. method:: Simulation.GetReciprocalLattice()

.. method:: Simulation.GetEpsilon(x, y, z)

	Retrieves the dielectric constant at a particular point in the system by reconstructing the Fourier series using the G-vectors of the system.

	Note that this reconstruction is not representative of the actual dielectric constant profile used in simulations (such a notion is not meaningful). The reconstruction is created using the closed-form Fourier series coefficients of the specified patterning, summed over the terms comprising the G-vector list obtained from lattice truncation. This function exists to provide an intuitive sense for the spatial resolution of a particular G-vector truncation order.

   Usage::

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. method:: Simulation.OutputStructurePOVRay([Filename])

	Outputs a `POV-Ray <http://www.povray.org>`_ script that will render one unit cell of the structure in 3D. Materials named ``air`` or ``vacuum`` (case insensitive) will be completely transparent.
	Note that the output is not guaranteed to be correct or parsable by POV-Ray; it is only meant as a starting point to produce publication-ready figures.

   Usage::

	S.OutputStructurePOVRay(Filename = 'out.pov')

   Arguments:

	Filename
		(string, optional) Filename to which the structure should be output. If this argument is not provided, standard output is used.

   Return values:

	None.

.. method:: Simulation.GetBasisSet()

		A tuples of tuples of length 2 holding the pairs of integer recprical lattice coordinates.


.. method:: Simulation.GetAmplitudes(Layer, zOffset=0)

Options
^^^^^^^

.. method:: Simulation.SetOptions(...)

	Sets various options for a `Simulation object`_. The options are described below, and any option not specified is left unchanged.

   Usage::
   
	S.SetOptions( # these are the defaults
		Verbosity = 0,
		LatticeTruncation = 'Circular',
		DiscretizedEpsilon = False,
		DiscretizationResolution = 8,
		PolarizationDecomposition = False,
		PolarizationBasis = 'Default',
		LanczosSmoothing = False,
		SubpixelSmoothing = False,
		ConserveMemory = False
	)

   Arguments:
   
	Verbosity
		(integer) The larger this value, the more status output is generated. Valid values are in the range of 0-9, inclusive. A value of 0 disables all status output.
	LatticeTruncation
		(string) Sets the type of lattice truncation to use when selecting G-vectors. Can be one of the following values:
		
		Circular
			This is the default. The G-vectors are selected to have shortest length (by l2 norm).
		Parallelogramic
			Chooses the G-vectors within a parallelogram aligned with the reciprocal lattice basis. The number chosen will always be a perfect square of an odd number.

	DiscretizedEpsilon
		(boolean) Enables or disables the use of discretization in generating the Fourier coefficients of the in-plane epsilon profiles, instead of using values from closed-form equations. When enabled, the coefficients are obtained by FFT.
	DiscretizationResolution
		(integer) This option only has an effect when ``DiscretizedEpsilon`` or ``SubpixelSmoothing`` are used.
		This function sets the resolution of the FFT grid and vector field generated by ``PolarizationDecomposition``.
		The resolution is multiplied by the largest G-vector extent (integer lattice coordinate), and should be at least 2 to satisfy the Nyquist limit. It is best to use a number with small integer factors in order for the FFT to be computed efficiently. The size of each dimension of the FFT is obviously proportional to this value. The default is 8.
		See the :ref:`fmm-formulations-label` for details.
	PolarizationDecomposition
		(boolean) Enables or disables the use of proper in-plane Fourier factorization rules by decomposing fields into a polarization basis which conforms to the material boundaries.
		The polarization basis field is generated automatically by computing a quasi-harmonic vector field everywhere tangent to the layer pattern boundaries.
		This option is not guaranteed to work in the presence of tensor dielectric constants.
		Enabling this feature typically improves convergence with respect to the number of G-vectors.
		See the :ref:`fmm-formulations-label` for details.
	PolarizationBasis
		(string) Sets the method by which the polarization decomposition basis is generated.
		This option only has an effect when ``PolarizationDecomposition`` is set.
		See the :ref:`fmm-formulations-label` for details.
		Valid choices are:
		
		Default
			Uses a smooth tangent vector field with respect to layer patterning.
		Normal
			Uses a unit normal vector field with respect to layer patterning.
		Jones
			Uses a complex-valued Jones polarization vector field.
		
	LanczosSmoothing
		(boolean or dict) A boolean value enables or disables smoothing of the Fourier series representations of the layer dielectric constants using the Lanczos sigma factor (box filtering). This reduces the Gibbs phenomenon ringing in the real space reconstruction.
		Otherwise, specify a dictionary with keys ``Power`` (positive integer) and/or ``Width`` (positive number) to change the properties of the smoothing function.
	SubpixelSmoothing
		(boolean) Enables or disables the use of second-order accurate epsilon averaging rules within a pixel.
		The average epsilon within a pixel is computed using the fill factor of each material and the interface direction.
		Enabling this feature may improve convergence with respect to the number of G-vectors.
		See the :ref:`fmm-formulations-label` for details.
	ConserveMemory
		(boolean) Setting this option will prevent storage of certain intermediate results. This will save approximately 30% memory for non-trivial layers.
		The drawback is slower computation of any output quantities that require solutions.
		
   Return values:
   
	None.
